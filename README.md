# LogCleaner Operator

## Project Story

### **The Challenge: Unmanaged Logs in Kubernetes**

As the world shifts towards cloud-native applications, more and more organizations are adopting Kubernetes to run their services at scale. Kubernetes provides immense flexibility, enabling applications to be deployed, managed, and scaled effortlessly. However, with great flexibility comes complexity. One of the challenges that developers often overlook is **log management**.

Imagine your team manages several microservices, each running inside a Kubernetes Pod. As these applications process requests, handle errors, and communicate with external systems, they generate logs—files that document everything happening within the application. These logs are invaluable for debugging, troubleshooting, and understanding the health of your systems.

But there's a catch.

Over time, these logs grow in size. If left unchecked, they can consume valuable disk space, slowing down your systems, and even causing your applications to crash when the storage is full. In production environments, the consequences of running out of space could be disastrous: services go down, users experience outages, and engineers scramble to fix the problem.

Your team could try to address this manually—someone could regularly log into the servers, check the file sizes, and delete the old or large logs. But as you scale, this quickly becomes an impossible task. Not only does it waste precious time, but there’s always the risk of missing something and running into disk issues.

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to **automate** this process, ensuring your system remains clutter-free without any manual intervention?

### **Automatic Log Management**

The **LogCleaner Operator** was created to solve this problem. It’s a tool designed to **automatically manage and clean up log files** from Kubernetes Pods. With this operator, teams no longer need to worry about their logs growing out of control or manually cleaning them up. The operator will monitor logs in your Kubernetes Pods, automatically cleaning or archiving them based on conditions that you set.

## Project Overview

As cloud-native applications and microservices grow, logs generated by these systems can quickly pile up, taking up valuable disk space. Over time, these logs, if not properly managed, can lead to performance degradation or even system crashes due to the exhaustion of storage resources. The **LogCleaner Operator** was conceived as a solution to this problem.

The **LogCleaner Operator** is designed to automatically manage logs within Kubernetes, cleaning up or archiving them once they exceed a certain size or age. This ensures that disk space is efficiently managed without manual intervention, allowing your systems to continue running smoothly.


Imagine this scenario:

Your team deploys an application—a microservice that handles hundreds or even thousands of requests every minute. The application generates logs to record important events, errors, and performance metrics. Initially, everything runs smoothly, but over the course of weeks or months, the log files grow larger and larger. Soon, your system starts to slow down, and you begin running out of disk space.

With the **LogCleaner Operator**, you no longer need to worry about this. The operator constantly monitors the log files in your application, ensuring they never grow beyond a certain size or remain on the system for too long. Once the logs reach the limits you’ve defined, the operator automatically cleans them up, freeing up space and keeping your system running smoothly.

### **How It Helps:**

- **Automating a Tedious Task:** Log management can be tedious and time-consuming. The **LogCleaner Operator** takes this burden off your shoulders, automating the process of checking and cleaning up logs. No more manually logging into servers to delete old logs or worrying about logs consuming valuable resources.
  
- **Improving System Performance:** Logs are critical for understanding the health of your system, but they shouldn’t slow it down. By keeping your logs in check, the operator ensures that your applications run efficiently without the risk of running out of space.

- **Preventing Downtime:** Systems crashing because of full disk space is a nightmare scenario, especially in production environments. The **LogCleaner Operator** proactively manages log files, preventing such scenarios from happening. Your team can rest easy, knowing that the operator is watching over the logs, ensuring everything remains under control.

- **Customizable to Your Needs:** Different applications have different logging needs. With the **LogCleaner Operator**, you can define exactly how you want your logs to be managed. Whether you want to delete old logs after a week or archive logs when they reach a certain size, the operator can be customized to fit your specific requirements.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of the **LogCleaner Operator** is to provide an automated way to manage and clean up logs generated by applications running inside Kubernetes Pods. By continuously monitoring log files and taking action when they grow too large or too old, the operator ensures that disk space remains available and your systems stay healthy.

### **Key Features of the LogCleaner Operator:**

1. **Automated Log Management**: No more manual log checks or cleanups. The operator will automatically take care of monitoring and managing logs.
2. **Customizable Behavior**: Users can define specific conditions, such as log file size and age limits, to trigger cleanup actions.
3. **Prevent Disk Overuse**: By cleaning up old and large logs, the operator helps prevent your system from running out of disk space.
4. **Improved Performance**: By keeping your system clutter-free, the operator ensures that your applications continue to perform well without being weighed down by excessive logs.
5. **Hands-off Maintenance**: With this operator in place, teams can focus on development without worrying about log-related system issues.

## Why Create the LogCleaner Operator?

In many Kubernetes environments, applications generate logs that need to be monitored and maintained. For example, a service running in production may create error logs, request logs, or audit logs. As time goes on, these logs can grow in size and eventually occupy a significant amount of storage. If not properly managed, this can lead to serious issues such as:

- **Performance Slowdowns**: Systems can slow down when disk space is consumed by log files.
- **Outages**: In the worst-case scenario, running out of disk space can cause services to crash, leading to potential downtime.
- **Manual Intervention**: Without an automated solution, someone has to log into the system regularly, check log files, and clean them up manually—an inefficient and error-prone process.

The **LogCleaner Operator** automates this process by keeping track of logs and performing cleanup tasks based on predefined rules. This not only saves time but also ensures that logs don’t grow uncontrollably, preventing future headaches.

## The Vision

Imagine a world where your logs are managed for you. As logs are created and accumulate in your system, the **LogCleaner Operator** will automatically detect when they become too large or too old. When this happens, the operator will clean them up or archive them, depending on your configuration. You no longer have to worry about running out of space or manually deleting log files.

This operator is designed with flexibility in mind. It allows users to define specific rules for different applications. For instance, you might want logs for critical applications to be archived rather than deleted, while less important services may simply have their logs removed after they grow too large.

With the **LogCleaner Operator**, your team can focus on what matters most—building and deploying great applications—while the operator ensures that log files are kept in check.

---

## How It Works

1. **Monitor**: The **LogCleaner Operator** continuously monitors the logs generated by your applications running in Kubernetes Pods.
2. **Define Limits**: Users can set limits on the log files based on size and age. When these limits are reached, the operator automatically takes action.
3. **Automate Cleanup**: Based on the configured settings, the operator either deletes the old or large logs, or it archives them for future reference.
4. **Ensure Efficiency**: This automated process ensures that your system doesn’t slow down due to excessive logs and disk space is always available.
